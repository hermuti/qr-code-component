### My Process

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project reinforced the importance of focusing on mobile-first design and how using flexbox can simplify layout creation. I also learned to implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the site looks good across various screen sizes, including mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px).

One challenge I overcame was ensuring the QR code image was properly aligned and scaled while maintaining the card's proportions. Here's an example of the CSS that helped me achieve this:

### css

.qr {
justify-content: center;
width: 100%;
max-width: 300px;
border-radius: 10px;
}
I also explored using custom properties for styling, which makes future updates much easier.

### Continued Development

I plan to focus more on mastering CSS Grid and flex box in future projects to handle more complex layouts. Additionally, I aim to refine my ability to integrate Javascript into my workflow for better visual consistency.

### Useful Resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This helped me better understand flexbox alignment and positioning, which was essential for centering the card.
